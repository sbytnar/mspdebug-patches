sbytnar/mspdebug-patches
=============

This code was forked from git://mspdebug.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/mspdebug/mspdebug.

My patches add support for debugging under Mac OS X Power PC.
The patches likely support any system that is big endian.
I didn't test the patches on little endian, so the patches
may require minor changes to support both big & little endian
systems.
